 ## Introduction
 Farasa is  an Arabic NLP toolkit serving the following tasks:
 1. Segmentation
 2. Stemming
 3. Named Entity Recgonition (NER).
 4. Part Of Speech tagging (POS tagging).
 5. Diacritization.

The toolkit is built with Java. Developers who want to use it can call the binaries API directly from their code.
As Pyhton is a general purpose language and so popular for many NLP tasks, an automation to these calls to the toolkit from the code would be convenient. This is where this wrapper fits.
